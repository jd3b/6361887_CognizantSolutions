## 1. Understanding Asymptotic Notation

### Big O Notation
Big O Notation represents the upper bound of an algorithm's runtime, describing its performance in terms of input size \(n\). It helps compare algorithms by focusing on their scalability.

### Scenarios for Search Operations
- **Best Case:** The desired item is found on the first attempt (\(O(1)\)).
- **Average Case:** Describes the expected performance over multiple runs.
- **Worst Case:** The algorithm examines all elements (\(O(n)\) for linear search, \(O(\log n)\) for binary search).

## 2. Setup

### Product Class
The `Product` class includes:
- `productId`: Unique identifier for the product.
- `productName`: Name of the product.
- `category`: Category to which the product belongs.

---

## 3. Implementation

### Linear Search
- **Description:** Sequentially checks each product in an array.
- **Suitability:** Suitable for unsorted datasets.
- **Complexity:** \(O(n)\).

### Binary Search
- **Description:** Splits the sorted array into halves.
- **Requirement:** Requires a sorted dataset.
- **Complexity:** \(O(\log n)\).

---

## 4. Analysis

### Comparison

#### Linear Search
- **Pros:** Works on unsorted data.
- **Cons:** Slower as the dataset grows.

#### Binary Search
- **Pros:** Faster for sorted datasets.
- **Cons:** Requires initial sorting (\(O(n \log n)\)).

### Suitability
Binary search is preferred for platforms with large, sorted datasets, as it scales better with increased data volume.
